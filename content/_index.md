# Rules of Being a Lady:

"The spirit of politeness consists in certain attention to forms and ceremonies, which are meant both to please others and ourselves, and to make others pleased with us."

---
A polite lady must...

# "Be self-sacrificing, friendly, unselfish."

---

"Be careful in conversation to avoid topics which may be supposed to have any direct reference to events or circumstances which may be painful for your companion to hear discussed."

---

"Never anticipate the point or joke of any anecdote told in your presence."

What is [really going on](https://hbr.org/2013/04/for-women-leaders-likability-a), as peer reviewed studies continually find, is that high-achieving women experience social backlash because their very success – and specifically the behaviors that created that success – violates our expectations about how women are supposed to behave. Women are expected to be nice, warm, friendly, and nurturing. Thus, if a woman acts assertively or competitively, if she pushes her team to perform, if she exhibits decisive and forceful leadership, she is deviating from the social script that dictates how she “should” behave. By violating beliefs about what women are like, successful women elicit pushback from others for being insufficiently feminine and too masculine. As descriptions like “Ice Queen,” and “Ballbuster” can attest, we are deeply uncomfortable with powerful women. In fact, we often don’t really like them.

# gender judo

I have [interviewed](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/16/opinion/sunday/gender-bias-work.html) about 200 women over the years in my research on gender and the workplace, and they all employ a similar set of strategies for escaping the likability trap. One former chief executive described hers this way: “I’m warm Ms. Mother 95 percent of the time, so that the 5 percent of the time when I need to be tough, I can be.”

---

What if you, [like me](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/27/us/likability-penalty.html), just don’t have the energy to engage in all that judo all day long?

It’s a concrete [fact](https://hbr.org/2018/06/research-women-ask-for-raises-as-often-as-men-but-are-less-likely-to-get-them#:~:text=The%20true%20gender%20pay%2Dgap,likely%20to%20negotiate%20their%20salaries) that women earn less than men do. The true gender pay-gap is not known with certainty, but, when comparing equally qualified people doing the same job, most estimates by labor economists put it at 10% – 20%.

Women who [initiate negotiations](https://gap.hks.harvard.edu/social-incentives-gender-differences-propensity-initiate-negotiations-sometimes-it-does-hurt-ask) in the workplace are more likely to be penalized than their male counterparts.
